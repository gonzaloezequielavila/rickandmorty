# Rick and Morty App

Created by Gonzalo Avila [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/gonzaloezequielavila/).

## Project made for [soyHenry](https://www.soyhenry.com/) as an integration homework

### Main idea of the app 
It's an integration homework, where we can learn to implement every detail that we learn in the Henry Bootcamp. 
We started off using only Front-End and requesting data directly from the Rick and Morty API that's online. We later integrated Back-End, making a bridge between the API and the React App. And finally we eneded up making a Database where we can store users and what different users want to store as their favorite characters.

## Bugs and Mistakes
Trying out this app, YOU WILL encounter a few mistakes, this was not intended to be a fully functional project, I wish everything worked as it should, but it's a working progress. üòÅ
